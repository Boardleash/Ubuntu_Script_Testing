# A script to create test files in various formats for TEST environments.
# A use-case for this is to create random files to test out a script or function on, without impacting other files.
# Tested on Ubuntu LTS 24.04 Desktop.
# There is also a "cleanup" function that will remove the created test files if they exist,
# but only in the directories mentioned in this script if they are there.
# If you do not want to cleanup the test files, just type "No" when prompted by the cleanup function.
# Alternatively, you can comment out the cleanup function, if desired.

# Create intro function.
