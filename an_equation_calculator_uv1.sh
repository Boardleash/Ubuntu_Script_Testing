### DESCRIPTION ###
###################
#
# This is a script that performs some basic math functions.
# The user will be asked to provide two numbers to be used by the script.
# PI in this script is limited to 3.14159.
# The range of numbers allowed is between -100 to 100 (excluding 0).
# This script does utilize the "bc" command, so if the package is not installed, it would need to be installed to execute successfully.
# The decimal limit is set to 5 places for decimal numbers in this script.
# This script does NOT need to be run with elevated privileges.
# Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS VM (Server w/GUI) in both graphical (GUI) and multi-user (Server) targets.
