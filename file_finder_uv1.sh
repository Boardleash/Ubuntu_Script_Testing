# An interactive script, with three options for finding files.
# This particular script has been tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Desktop VM image.
# Ensure correct permissions have been set (chmod) if having issues running this script.
# This script is not intended to be ran with elevated permissions, but could be.
# Directories and files searched are limited to home directories (for simplicity).
# If deeper searches are preferred, make appropriate changes to code.

# Set up an interactive greeting.
